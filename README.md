# Wolfpack-ROS
Wolfpack Robotics is experimenting with offloading robot processing from the RoboRio to a co-proccessor.

Our roadmap to begin is going to be simple. We want to prove our capabilities utiilzing a co-processor before we delegate any more robot functions off the RoboRio.

- Utilize the open souce project ROS
- Implement AprilTag processing on ROS as a proof of concept
